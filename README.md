# RayTracer_Challenge
The Ray Tracer was modeled after the Ray Tracer from the book by Jamis Buck in C#, is currently still in the development phase. The ReadMe.md file and a better documentation will follow.  If you find bugs or other things, let me know.  The RayTracer runs on MacOS and on Windows in Visual Studio.
